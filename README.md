# Cryptography
simple encryption program

This project implements a Caesar Cipher variation for encrypting and decrypting text using a dynamic key. The program demonstrates character-level encryption based on ASCII manipulation.

The user inputs two lines:
  1. **Plaintext message**
  2. **Encryption key**

The key is padded to match the length of the message.
Each character in the message is encrypted by adding its ASCII value to the corresponding key character's ASCII value.
The result is:

   Encrypted string
   ASCII representation of encrypted characters (hyphen-separated)
   Decrypted string (original message restored)
